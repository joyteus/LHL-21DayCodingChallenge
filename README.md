# LHL-21DayCodingChallenge
Lighthouse Labs | 21-Day Coding Challenge | May 2019 

"Over the next 21 days you’ll be travelling aboard the exploratory vessel ISS Lighthouse, on a mission to explore the galaxy.

Just as you depart the solar system, a gigantic space bug knocks you off course! 
As the ISS Lighthouse captain, you’ll need to solve daily coding challenges to repair the ship and continue on your mission."

This will be my journey of the challenge! Wish me luck! (^_^)
