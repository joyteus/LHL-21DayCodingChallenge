# LHL-21DayCodingChallenge
Lighthouse Labs | 21-Day Coding Challenge | May 2019 

"Over the next 21 days you’ll be travelling aboard the exploratory vessel ISS Lighthouse, on a mission to explore the galaxy.

Just as you depart the solar system, a gigantic space bug knocks you off course! 
As the ISS Lighthouse captain, you’ll need to solve daily coding challenges to repair the ship and continue on your mission."

**Global Objects:**

There are a few objects you're going to be working with and their initial values. This is only a subset of them, to give you a idea of what they look like. You can see below that they're all messed up:

    var navigation = {
      x: -2,
      y: "Banana",
      z: "Beep",
      speed: "raaaaid"
    };

    var ship = {
      powerOn: false,
      modules: [],
      antenna: {
        active: false
      }
    };

    var radio = {
      frequency: "Kenneth",
      message: "Bugs are cool.",
      beacon: false
    };
    
**This will be my journey of the challenge! Wish me luck! (^_^)**
